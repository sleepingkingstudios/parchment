By casting the spell again on the same patch of earth, you can gain some rough details about one of creatures that have passed. You can learn one fact from the following list: the species, weight, or gender of a creature, or what it was wearing on its feet (barefoot, shoes, sandals, clawed toes, etc).

**At Higher Levels:** You can learn one additional fact about a passing creature, including the first time the spell is cast.",
