  short_description:  Floating light illuminates 20 feet + 20 feet dim light
  description: |
    You conjure a glowing, spectral orb the size of a closed fist and bearing
    the likeness of everyone's favorite creature, the Flumph. Until the spell
    ends, the orb sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an
    additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. The spell ends if
    you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

    You can move the orb to anywhere within 30 feet of you as a bonus action. If
    you move more than 30 feet away from the orb, it will float directly to your
    location at the beginning of your next turn; if it is unable to reach your
    location, the spell immediately ends.

  short_description:  Next weapon attack deals +2d6 radiant damage
  description: |
    The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell
    ends, the weapon is wrapped with a ghostly Flumph tentacle as you strike.
    The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, which becomes
    visible if it's invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius
    and can't become invisible until the spell ends.

    **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
    level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
    2nd.

  short_description:  Protect 10 ft circle from Flumphs.
  description: |
    You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy
    centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing
    runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other
    surface. The circle affects all Flumphs in the following ways:

    - A Flumph can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the
      creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it
      must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
    - The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the
      cylinder.
    - Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by
      the creature.

    When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the
    reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving
    the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

    **At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
    level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above
    3rd.
